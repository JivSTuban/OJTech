# Active Context: OJTech Platform

## Current Development Focus

We are focusing on implementing the **Application Tracking System** while continuing to fix issues with the **Job Application Process** and the **Employer Job Management** functionality for the OJTech platform.

## Recent Changes

### Application Tracking Implementation
- Connected the Track page with real application data from the database
- Implemented filtering of applications by status (All, Pending, Reviewed, Shortlisted)
- Added loading states and empty state handling
- Created a better UI for displaying application details
- Added navigation to view job details
- Improved skill matching display between user skills and job requirements

### Database Constraint Fix for Job Applications
- Fixed a database constraint issue in the `matches` table that was preventing job applications
- Updated the `matches_status_check` constraint to include 'applied' and 'declined' status values
- Created documentation to track database constraints
- Successfully applied the migration to production

### Employer Job Dashboard Implementation
- Created a tabbed interface for viewing jobs by status (All, Draft, Active, Closed)
- Implemented job statistics display showing counts by status
- Added functionality to create new job postings
- Integrated job deletion with confirmation
- Built responsive layout for various screen sizes
- Connected to employer-specific job data via server actions

### Job Status Workflow
- Implemented the job status lifecycle:
  - **Draft**: Initial creation state, not visible to students
  - **Active**: Published state, visible to students for applications
  - **Closed**: No longer accepting applications, archived
- Added UI indicators for each status
- Created server actions to transition between statuses

## Technical Considerations

### Data Flow
- Server actions retrieve employer-specific job listings using authenticated user ID
- Student applications are fetched using the getStudentApplications server action
- Application data includes related job details through join queries
- Client-side state management handles filtering by application status
- Toast notifications provide feedback on successful/failed operations

### Match Status Management
- Match status values now include: 'pending', 'accepted', 'rejected', 'applied', 'declined'
- Job application process updates match status to 'applied'
- Job declining process updates match status to 'declined'
- Database constraints enforce valid status values
- Critical for job application tracking and workflow

### Component Architecture
- Reusable JobList component displays jobs with appropriate actions
- JobCard component shows job details in a condensed format
- Application tracking page uses tabs for status filtering
- Modal dialogs for confirmation actions (delete, status changes)
- Tab system for organizing different job views

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Add detailed application view for students
2. Implement notifications for application status changes
3. Complete end-to-end testing of the job application process
4. Add more comprehensive error handling for the application process

### Upcoming Work
1. Improve the student-facing job browsing experience
2. Enhance the job application submission workflow
3. Build the application review system for employers
4. Implement the skills matching algorithm for job recommendations

## Decisions and Trade-offs

### Database Schema Evolution
- Added new valid status values to match status constraint instead of removing it
- Created documentation to track database constraints for future reference
- Chose to use database-level constraints to ensure data integrity

### Application Tracking UX
- Used tabbed interface for better organization of different application statuses
- Implemented loading states for better user experience
- Added empty state handling with helpful guidance
- Displayed detailed job information for better context

### Authentication Requirements
- All job management routes and actions are protected, requiring employer authentication
- Application tracking requires student authentication
- Server actions verify user role before allowing operations

### UI/UX Considerations
- Prioritized simplicity in the dashboard layout for easy job management
- Used visual indicators (icons, colors) to clearly show job status
- Added confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Implemented loading states to provide feedback during data operations

### Performance Optimization
- Fetch jobs on component mount and after state-changing operations
- Filter applications client-side to reduce server requests
- Use efficient state updates for real-time UI changes
- Limit initial application fetch to 50 records for faster loading

## Integration Points

### Supabase Database
- Jobs table stores all job posting data
- Job_applications table tracks applications submitted by students
- Matches table tracks relationships between students and jobs
- RLS policies control access based on user roles
- Queries filter data by user ID for security

### Authentication System
- Middleware protects routes based on user roles
- User role verification prevents unauthorized access
- Session data provides user ID for queries

### UI Framework
- Uses shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Toast system for user notifications

## Open Questions

1. Should we add more status types for the job application workflow?
2. What metrics should we track for job application performance?
3. How can we optimize the matching algorithm for the most relevant job recommendations?
4. Should we implement batch operations for managing multiple job applications?
5. How should we notify students of application status changes?
