## Current Status

As of May 2024, the project is in the development phase with focus on completing the student application tracking features and job applications system. We recently connected the Track page with real application data from the database. The authentication system is functional with a robust auth provider implementation. The basic infrastructure is in place, and the UI framework is established. We recently fixed a database constraint issue that was blocking the job application process.

## Recent Updates

### May 9, 2025
- Implemented real application data fetching in the Track page
- Added status-based filtering for applications
- Created improved UI for displaying application details
- Added loading and empty states to handle all scenarios

### May 7, 2025
- Fixed database constraint for matches table to allow 'applied' and 'declined' status values
- Created documentation to track database constraints
- Successfully tested the job application workflow with the fixed constraint

## Next Steps
1. Complete detailed application view for students
2. Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases 
3. Build application management for employers
4. Develop skills matching algorithm
5. Add analytics for employers and administrators

## Bugfixes and Technical Debt

### Known Issues
- [ ] Inconsistent loading states across components
- [ ] Error handling improvements needed for edge cases
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness needs refinement
- [ ] Form validation error messages need standardization
- [ ] Cloudinary upload error handling improvements

### Recent Fixes
- [x] Fixed database constraint for match status values
- [x] Added documentation for database constraints
- [x] Connected Track page with real application data

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Standardize API response formats
- [ ] Refactor authentication flow for code reuse
- [ ] Update TypeScript types for better type safety
- [ ] Optimize database queries for performance
- [ ] Setup proper CI/CD pipeline
